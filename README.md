Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network
======================================

This software implements OCR system using CNN + RNN + CTCLoss, inspired by CRNN network.

Usage
-----
Train & dev: `python train.py`

Test: `python inference.py`

# Requirements 
1. Create new virtualenv 
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt' `   

# Config 
Use on server 8082. No need to change config. Data path is already available.
